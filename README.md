## Javascript Coding Problems

**Credits:** The exercises are based on the book **Java Coding Problems**, which corresponds to the author **Anghel Leonard** [Packt>](https://www.packt.com). Personally, I also recommend that you buy it, as it will provide greater detail in solving the challenges (in the Java language).

Within this repository, for practical purposes, the exercises are solved purely with Javascript.
