## Chapter 01 -  Problem 18. Check to strings Anagrams

## Description:
Write a program that checks if two strings are anagrams.
Note: An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. The new word or phrase created from the rearrangement must use all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word "listen" can be rearranged to form the word "silent," which is an anagram of "listen." Anagrams are often used in word games and puzzles, as they can provide a fun and challenging way to test one's vocabulary and problem-solving skills.
