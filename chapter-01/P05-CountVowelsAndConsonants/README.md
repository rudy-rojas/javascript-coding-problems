## Chapter 01 - Problem 04. Count vowels and consonants

## Description:

The goal of this algorithm is to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. To do this, each character in the string is checked to see if it is a vowel or a consonant. A vowel counter is incremented if the character is a vowel, and a consonant counter is incremented if the character is a consonant.
